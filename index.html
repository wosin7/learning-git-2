  <h3>Bob Marley - Three little birds</h3>
  <p>
    "Don't worry about a thing
    'Cause every little thing gonna be alright"
     Singin', "Don't worry about a thing
    'Cause every little thing gonna be alright"
  </p>
  <p>
    Rise up this mornin', smiled with the risin' sun
    Three little birds perched by my doorstep
    Singin' sweet songs of melodies pure and true
    Sayin', "This is my message to you"
  </p>
  <p>
      Singin', "Don't worry 'bout a thing
      'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright
      Singin', "Don't worry (Don't worry) 'bout a thing
      'Cause every little thing gonna be alright
